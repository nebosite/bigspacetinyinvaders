TODO
    [x] Speedup: Aliens and alien bullets don't need to do hit tests unless they are down at shield level
    [x] Fix performance window
    [x] Bug main menu alien is off center
    [x] Bug: One of the sound effects is slightly annoying on my sound system 
        (which is very accurate). It sounds like a sharp tick. Consider swapping 
        it with something less abrasive.
    [x] New wave when all ships are lost
    [x] Bug: The game crashed when I lost. All the ships died by crashing into my shields, 
        then the game froze.
        [x] Killing all the aliens spawns a new wave
    [x] Start with a tiny "standard" invader wave
    [x] 2nd wave is huge
    [x] Fly the hive in




    [x] Show aliens left next to score
    [ ] Blue powerup: Plasma blast useing extra shot button
    [ ] Bug: I got two player ships but one which I could not move would shoot, 
        and one that would not shoot would move. Repro: Start the game by detecting 
        an Xbox 360 controller. Press Start on the controller to start a game. Immediately 
        spam the Start button while playing. Result: Multiple player ships are 
        spawned but only one can be controlled left and right while the other one shoots.
    [ ] I am not clear how I am getting bonuses/upgrades. These moments could use more 
        "advertising/celebration" messaging with visuals and sound.
    [ ] Play sound with text for powerups
    [ ] Celebrate a victory


    [ ] Bug: leaving full screen leaves all  of the menu stuff messed up in the corner (only after completing a game)

NEW
    [ ] Missing controller instructions
    [ ] Hard time seeing the difference in the object types. 
        So far I think there are these types of things flying through the air. 
        Maybe they could be differentiated by different colors? It all looks the same to me. 
        My bullets flying up (I suggest Blue)
        Bombs dropping down (I suggest Red - says these are dangerous)
        Bonus pickups dropping down? (I suggest Green) - Says to go get these)
        Debris dropping down (I suggest gray - says these don't matter)
    [ ] I really wish you had some music going on.
    [ ] Balancing, at first it was really easy. Then it got challenging, then it 
        got impossible. Not sure what to do about this. Maybe more powerups would 
        make the entire thing funner by speeding up the beginning, add strategy 
        to the middle, and power at the end.
    [ ] Some kind of bonus for shooting all the way through one of your own defenses 
        as a pillbox defense.
    [ ] Bonus Powerup: Companion ships appear with offset positions to the left 
        and right of your ship. They move and fire as if they are twinning 
        your ship. The player has an opportunity to have more firepower for a 
        short duration, but has to manage three ships instead of one. When they 
        die they do not respawn.

NEXT
    [ ] 1/2 max score dynamic
        [ ] Game over when all players are dead or score < max/#active players
        [ ] Highlight the player when their death will end the game  (They are "it")
    [ ] Dynamic: UFO's loiter over the aliens.  You need a way to punch through to get them.
    [ ] Dynamic: Shields protect charging stations.  Weapons charge slower when they are damaged.  
        - Weapons won't charge at all if the are all damaged
    [ ] Put the heat and battery bars on the player
        [ ] Powerup shows up on player status with a lifetime indicator
        [ ] Show accumulated alien energy in the player status - alien battery should be 5-10x regular battery   

SOON
    [ ] Game over
        [ ] Show intermediate game over screen when the game exists
        [ ] Game should exit when all players are dead
        [ ] Aliens continue to drop down.  When they land, they crawl off like bugs
    [ ] Powerup: Laser blast shot.  Get this from a laser blast UFO
    [ ] Powerup: Turn the big blue blob into a 10 super-bullets
    [ ] Use your google ads credit to promote your site
    [ ] Player Animation on entry
    [ ] highscores
    [ ] Pack resources too: https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/

LATER
    [ ] Get a cert for https (easy to do with ionos?)
    [ ] Maybe make fan shot bullets more expensive
    [ ] Make it obvious that a powerup was destroyed
    [ ] Dynamic: waves move into other game territory - asteroids, star castle... or into space, then to their planet
    [ ] powerup:  That Guy.  An alien is targeted (highlighted by a cursor) lots of little bullets swarm like heat seakers to that one
    [ ] Powerup: Extra ship
    [ ] Powerup: Nuke - like a big firework creates pandemonium with falling debris
    [ ] Powerup: Crazy bear.  Cute teddy bear gets madder and madder as it takes hits.  Release for havoc.  
        Too many hits and it attacks players.
    [ ] Remember controllers long-term (and assign names)
    [ ] Use scaling to make fonts look better on large screens
    [ ] Bug: Sometimes can't get back into game when two people are on the same controller and one dies
    [ ] Score graph
    [ ] Powerup: Homing shots
    [ ] More powerups when coop score is high
        - playing "zone"
        - powerups distributed
        - kills distributed
        - sharing energy with others
    [ ] Resizing should reset game object positions

PROBABLY NEVER
    [ ] One Gigantic invader
    [ ] Bullets should kill bullets?
    [ ] Add concept of children in drawing code to simplify the movement of complex objects
    [ ] Improve canvas performance
        https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/performance/
    [ ] Setup tests with JEST  https://itnext.io/step-by-step-building-and-publishing-an-npm-typescript-package-44fe7164964c
    [ ] Alert when using IE
