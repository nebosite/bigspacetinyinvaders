TODO
    [x] Make it harder to hit small debris
    [x] Too easy to shoot powerup - maybe a few more hit points on the powerup
    [x] Game entry window should be Smaller
    [x] Bug: Escaping out of full screen does not end game
    [ ] bug: when things slide into the player, they do not get picked up
    [ ] Delay player re-entry
    [ ] Game over
        [ ] Show intermediate game over screen when the game exists
        [ ] Game should exit when all players are dead
        [ ] Aliens continue to drop down.  When they land, they crawl off like bugs
    [ ] aliens should show damage
        [ ] Alient shield animation/sound when aliens are hit and don't die
        [ ] Sparks when aliens are hit
    [ ] Put the heat and battery bars on the player
        [ ] Powerup shows up on player status with a lifetime indicator
        [ ] Show accumulated alien energy in the player status - alien battery should be 5-10x regular battery   
    [ ] Bug: Picking up a powerup did not reset bullet count
    [ ] Aliens run into shields - each damaging the other - different sound for this plus sparks
    [ ] Players die when colliding with aliens
    [ ] Maybe make fan shot bullets more expensive
    [ ] Make it obvious that a powerup was destroyed
    [ ] Different sound when knocking out debris
    [ ] Get a cert for https (easy to do with ionos?)

NEW


NEXT
    [ ] Fly the hive in
    [ ] Killing last alien should generate a new hive
    [ ] Needs a celebration at the end of the level
    [ ] 1/2 max score dynamic
        [ ] Game over when all players are dead or score < max/#active players
        [ ] Highlight the player when their death will end the game  (They are "it")
    [ ] Dynamic: UFO's loiter over the aliens.  You need a way to punch through to get them.
    [ ] Dynamic: Shields protect charging stations.  Weapons charge slower when they are damaged.  
        - Weapons won't charge at all if the are all damaged

SOON
    [ ] Powerup: Laser blast shot.  Get this from a laser blast UFO
    [ ] Powerup: Turn the big blue blob into a 10 super-bullets
    [ ] Use your google ads credit to promote your site
    [ ] Player Animation on entry
    [ ] highscores
    [ ] Pack resources too: https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/

LATER
    [ ] Dynamic: waves move into other game territory - asteroids, star castle... or into space, then to their planet
    [ ] powerup:  That Guy.  An alien is targeted (highlighted by a cursor) lots of little bullets swarm like heat seakers to that one
    [ ] Powerup: Extra ship
    [ ] Powerup: Nuke - like a big firework creates pandemonium with falling debris
    [ ] Powerup: Crazy bear.  Cute teddy bear gets madder and madder as it takes hits.  Release for havoc.  
        Too many hits and it attacks players.
    [ ] Remember controllers long-term (and assign names)
    [ ] Use scaling to make fonts look better on large screens
    [ ] Bug: Sometimes can't get back into game when two people are on the same controller and one dies
    [ ] Score graph
    [ ] Powerup: Homing shots
    [ ] More powerups when coop score is high
        - playing "zone"
        - powerups distributed
        - kills distributed
        - sharing energy with others
    [ ] Resizing should reset game object positions

PROBABLY NEVER
    [ ] One Gigantic invader
    [ ] Bullets should kill bullets?
    [ ] Add concept of children in drawing code to simplify the movement of complex objects
    [ ] Improve canvas performance
        https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/performance/
    [ ] Setup tests with JEST  https://itnext.io/step-by-step-building-and-publishing-an-npm-typescript-package-44fe7164964c
    [ ] Alert when using IE
