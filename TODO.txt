TODO
    [x] Fan Shot powerup - less powerful bullets, but fanned out
        [x] Create power icon for fan shot
        [x] Add a new kind of alien debris 
        [x] Picking up a powerup adds new logic to the gun 
            - Gun has a chain of responsibility pattern for gun logic?
        [x] Fan power up works like those rapid shooting fireworks, fanning back and forth
            - Overall damage should be 2x 
            - heat draw should be 50% overall
    [ ] Bug: keyboard controls get way messed up with multiple players
    [ ] Powerup: Laser blast shot.  Get this from a laser blast UFO
    [ ] Fly the hive in
    [ ] Killing last alien should generate a new hive
    [ ] Show accumulated alien energy in the player status - alien battery should be 5-10x regular battery   
 
NEW
    [ ] Powerup shows up on player status with a lifetime indicator
    [ ] aliens should show damage
    [ ] Dynamic: waves move into other game territory - asteroids, star castle... or into space, then to their planet
    [ ] powerup:  That Guy.  An alien is targeted (highlighted by a cursor) lots of little bullets swarm like heat seakers to that one
    [ ] One Gigantic invader
    [ ] Powerup: Extra ship
    [ ] Escaping out of full screen should stop the game 
    [ ] Alient shield animation/sound when aliens are hit and don't die

EASY/URGENT


NEXT
    [ ] Aliens "eat" Shields
    [ ] Players die when colliding with aliens
    [ ] Delay player re-entry
    [ ] Game over when all players are dead or score < max/#active players
    [ ] Give ships more hit points and make bullets stronger
    [ ] Generate alien rows gradually in waves (add animation)
    [ ] When Hive dies, kick off next level
    [ ] Game over
        [ ] Show intermediate game over screen when the game exists
        [ ] Game should exit when all players are dead
    [ ] Aliens can win

SOON
    [ ] Dynamic: UFO's loiter over the aliens.  You need a way to punch through to get them.
    [ ] Dynamic: Shields protect charging stations.  Weapons charge slower when they are damaged.  
        - Weapons won't charge at all if the are all damaged
    [ ] Powerup: Nuke - like a big firework creates pandemonium with falling debris
    [ ] Powerup: Crazy bear.  Cute teddy bear gets madder and madder as it takes hits.  Release for havoc.  
        Too many hits and it attacks players.

LATER
    [ ] Use your google ads credit to promote your site
    [ ] Player Animation on entry
    [ ] Remember controllers long-term (and assign names)
    [ ] highscores
    [ ] Use scaling to make fonts look better on large screens
    [ ] Bug: Sometimes can't get back into game when two people are on the same controller and one dies
    [ ] Score graph
    [ ] Powerup: Homing shots
    [ ] More powerups with coop score is high
        - playing "zone"
        - powerups distributed
        - kills distributed
        - sharing energy with others
    [ ] Resizing should reset game object positions
    [ ] Pack resources too: https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/

PROBABLY NEVER
    [ ] Bullets should kill bullets?
    [ ] Add concept of children in drawing code to simplify the movement of complex objects
    [ ] Improve canvas performance
        https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/performance/
    [ ] Setup tests with JEST  https://itnext.io/step-by-step-building-and-publishing-an-npm-typescript-package-44fe7164964c
    [ ] Alert when using IE
