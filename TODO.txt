TODO
    [ ] Pregame mode
        title graphic
        no player picking, just a menu
        some instructions and details
        full screen mode option  https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_fullscreen.asp
        "Change browser zoom for larger game characters"
        Move to fullscreen when the game actually starts 
        Return to pregame when all players are dead
    [ ] Burst firing - build up a firing charge when not firing so that when the button is first pressed, you peel off a could of shots right away
    [ ] Replace exploding ship with magic debris
    [ ] Collect debris to increase shot rate

NEW
    [ ] Remember controllers long-term (and assign names)
    [ ] highscores
    [ ] Better player status displays
    [ ] "Use Movement controls..." should be framed somehow. 
    [ ] Powerup: Nuke - like a big firework creates pandemonium with falling debris

EASY/URGENT


NEXT

SOON
    [ ] Aliens can win
    [ ] When Hive dies, kick off next level
    [ ] Generate alien rows gradually in waves (add animation)
    [ ] Animation on entry
    [ ] Fan Shot powerup - less powerful bullets, but fanned out
    [ ] Give ships more hit points and make bullets stronger

LATER
    [ ] Bug: Sometimes can't get back into game when two people are on the same controller and one dies
    [ ] Score graph
    [ ] Powerup: Homing shots
    [ ] More powerups with coop score is high
        - playing "zone"
        - powerups distributed
        - kills distributed
        - sharing energy with others
    [ ] Resizing should reset game object positions
    [ ] Pack resources too: https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/

PROBABLY NEVER
    [ ] Bullets should kill bullets?
    [ ] Add concept of children in drawing code to simplify the movement of complex objects
    [ ] Improve canvas performance
        https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/performance/
    [ ] Maybe fancier sound system: https://marcgg.com/blog/2016/11/01/javascript-audio/
    [ ] Setup tests with JEST  https://itnext.io/step-by-step-building-and-publishing-an-npm-typescript-package-44fe7164964c
    [ ] Alert when using IE
